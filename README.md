# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component


## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, I need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

My challenge is build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge. 

I should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
